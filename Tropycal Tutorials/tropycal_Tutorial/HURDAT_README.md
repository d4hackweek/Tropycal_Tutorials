# Tropical Cyclone Analysis with `tropycal`

## Overview

This tutorial demonstrates how to use the `tropycal` Python package to analyze and visualize tropical cyclone data. We specifically focus on the HURDAT2 dataset, which provides detailed records of Atlantic tropical cyclones, and show how to load, analyze, and visualize this data using `tropycal`.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the necessary Python environment set up. You can use the provided `environment.yml` file to create an environment with all the required dependencies:

\`\`\`bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate <your_environment_name>
\`\`\`

### Files Included

- `HURDAT_Tutorial.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the tutorial.
- `README.md`: This file.
- `environment.yml`: The environment file for setting up dependencies.

### Running the Tutorial

1. Open the `HURDAT_Tutorial.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook.
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to run the code cells and explore the data.
